OglyPred-PLM: Human O-linked Glycosylation Site Prediction Using Pretrained Protein Language Model

Programs were executed using Anaconda version: 2020.07

The programs were developed in the following environment. python: 3.8.3.final.0, python-bits: 64, OS: Linux, OS-release: 5.8.0-38-generic, machine: x86_64, processor: x86_64, pandas: 1.0.5, numpy: 1.18.5, pip: 20.1.1, scipy: 1.4.1, sci-kit-learn: 0.23.1., Keras: 2.4.3, tensorflow: 2.3.1.

Please place all the following files in the same directory Comparision with SPRINT-Gly.ipynb, Feature_Extraction_July_30_Sprint_Gly_Negative_Independent_Test_3376_.txt, Feature_Extraction_July_30_Sprint_Gly_Positive_Independent_Test_79_.txt (In the publicly shared google drive), Compare_with_Sprint_Gly486__103928619___.h5, and execute the Comparision with SPRINT-Gly.ipynb program to see the reported result.

Please place all the following files in the same directory SUMO_2_3_Independent_Test_Set_Testing.ipynb, Independent_Test_Set_of_Hendriks_et_al_SUMO_2_3.csv (In the publicly shared google drive), SUMO2_330482327.h5, and execute the SUMO_2_3_Independent_Test_Set_Testing.ipynb program to see the reported result.

Please place all the following files in the same directory GPS SUMO Independent Testing.ipynb, GPS_Testing_Prot_T5_feature.txt (In the publicly shared google drive), GPS_SUMO_Independent_test82423____13.h5, and execute the GPS SUMO Independent Testing.ipynb program to see the reported result.

If you want to test if the sites of a protein is SUMOylated or not: Please place all the following files in the same directory SUMOylation_P10275_Test.ipynb, Subash_Chandra_Pakhrin5775457372.h5, P10275_Prot_Trans_.csv (Change this feature file with your interest, generate it using the analyze_Cell_Mem_ER_Extrac_Protein.py program) and execute the SUMOylation_P10275_Test.ipynb you will see the result which K are SUMOylated.

If you want to test if the sites of a protein is SUMO2/3 SUMOylated or not: Please place all the following files in the same directory SUMO_2_3_P10275_Test.ipynb, SUMO2_330482327.h5, P10275_Prot_Trans_.csv (Change this feature file with your interest, generate it using the analyze_Cell_Mem_ER_Extrac_Protein.py program) and execute the SUMO_2_3_P10275_Test.ipynb you will see the result which K are SUMO2/3 SUMOylated.

*** For your convenience we have uploaded the ProtT5 feature extraction program (analyze_Cell_Mem_ER_Extrac_Protein.py) for the protein sequence from ProtT5 as well as corresponding 1024 feature vector extraction program (Feature Extraction Program from the generated files.ipynb) from the ProtT5 file. ***

All the training and independent test data are uploaded at the following google drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MzfuMltEGF7jxKjzwLZx0gNuSDsLT7tO?usp=sharing
